    "The goal of this notebook is to develop tools to measure trip time end-to-end.\n",
    "The specific usecase now is to compare trip durations before and after \"Nativ +\" initiative and analyze the differences (if any).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps:\n",
    "1. pick route ids and dates.  \n",
    "* Query the \"Open Bus\" splunk database and retrive siri real time data for these routes in the chosen dates.  \n",
    "* Query the \"Open Bus\" splunk database and retrieve stops locations for these routes. **Route stats or trip stats??**  \n",
    "* Estimate the time the bus passed in the second** stop and the time it arrived to the last stop, and report their   difference as the trip approximate duration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "** We use the second stop because it is easier to estimate when a bus passes a stop than estimate the time a bus started its trip. For the first stop there can be many cases such as - bus is very late and drives towards the first stop at the time it was suppose to depart, which can cause false departure time estimation.\n",

    "In order to retrieve data from our splunk database, I am going to use the [splunk utils](https://github.com/hasadna/open-bus/tree/master/splunk/SplunkUtills) module"
